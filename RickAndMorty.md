# Rick and Morty

Rick and Morty attend to be a smaller and well organized project. It makes use of MVVM pattern, and follow the Human Interface Guidelines (HIGs) from Apple. Since we never know how much a project could growth, we start using protocols from the beginning to split responsibilities between classes, allowing Unit Testing and Integration Testing. Snapshot or Screen Testing is out of consideration for this project. Finally, the project uses Combine like a native reactive framework

The main goal here is to follow SOLID and good development practices.
